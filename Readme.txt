Gradient Product Transform for Symmetry Detection in Images
===========================================================

This is the source code of the program "gptsymmetry", which implements
the algorithm described in (cited as "IPOL paper" below):

C. Dalitz, J. Wilberg: "The Gradient Product Transform:
An Image Filter for Symmetry Detection." IPOL, 2019

gptsymmetry reads a PNG image, prints the detected symmetries to stdout
and optionally writes images showing a skeleton of symmetry axes and
of the detected symmetric objects.


Compilation
-----------

Building the code requires cmake and a standard C++98 (or later) compiler.
We have tested the code with gcc 5.4.0, LLVM 9.0.0, and MSVC 14.1.

The number of kernels used for parallel computation can be set by the
variable NUM_THREADS in CMakeLists.txt. Parallelization requires OpenMP
to be installed. While OpenMP is supported by default on Linux, it must
must be installed manually on OSX with "brew install libomp". Moreover,
at least cmake version 3.12 is required for OpenMP support on OSX and for
MSVC, whilst on other platforms cmake 3.5 is sufficient.

Before running cmake, you should adjust the variable NUM_THREADS in
CMakeLists.txt to the number of kernels on your system.

Starting from the root directory (i.e., the directory, in which this
Readme file is located), the executable "gptsymmetry" is created with
($ is the shell prompt):

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  $ make

To test the program, you can apply it to the test image included in this
source package as follows:

  $ gptsymmetry -r 80 -o result.png ../testimage.png

This will mark the detected symmetries in the result image file "result.png".


Usage
-----

Calling gptsymmetry without any or with an unknown option (e.g. "-?")
will print a usage message. The meaning of the parameters controlling
the algorithm is explained in the IPOL paper.

The input file must be in PNG format. With the option "-o <outfile>", the
detected symmetry regions are darwn into the image and written to <outfile>.
Unless the option "-notrace" is given, three additional images are written:

  trace-symmetry.png:
    the GPT symmetry score converted to grayscale
  trace-ridges.png:
    skeletons of symmetry axes
  trac-localmaxpoints.png:
    the symmetry regions classified into axial (red) an rotational (cyan)

The detected symmetry regions are printed to stdout in the following format:

  rot;x;y;rx;ry;S;s_norm
  0;142;317;5;23;5044167.206566;0.903770
  0;141;325;5;14;4800286.097710;0.947354
  1;295;198;32;33;4569864.069128;0.784917
  0;106;298;38;42;3361987.012759;0.720138

where "rot" indicates rotational (1) or axial (0) symmetry, (x,y) is the
center and (rx,ry) the size of the symmetry region, S is the GPT score,
and s_norm is the normalized GPT score between zero and one. Thus, to report
only rotational symmetries, you can pipe the output to grep as follows:

  $ gptsymmetry -r 100 -notrace test.png | grep '^1'
