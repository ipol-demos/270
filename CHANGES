Change log of gptsymmetry
=========================

Version 1.1 from 2019-10-29
---------------------------

 - fixed serious bug in option "-which (dark|light)", which
   lead to randomly erroneous symmetry score:
   rx and ry now defined as long (instead of unsigned long) so that
   they can be multiplied with negative constants

 - info how to enable optimization during compilation in Readme added


Version 1.0 from 2019-07-09
---------------------------

 - first creation
